# Tenorite

Tenorite aims to simplify building concurrent systems with Rust.

The APIs, structure and goals of this project may change as I continue to develop my Rust-fu. Please do not use it for any critical systems in it's current form... yet!

No proper documentation exists yet, but there is [an example repo](https://github.com/KennethWilke/tenorite-example)!
